    <h2>Egyptian Motif</h2>
    <div class="learn">
        <img class="indent" src="../../afb/" />
        <img src="../../afb/" />
        <p>Much Islamic art applies principles of geometry and repeats simple patterns to form complex forms. For
            example, the Egyptian Motif above has six overlapping rectangles.</p>
        <p><strong>In this project,</strong> you will learn how to extend your <code>pinwheel</code> code from Unit 1 to
            create such intricate patterns.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
        <ol>
            <li>
                In this project, you will repeatedly use rectangles, so first recall how to create a
                <code>rectangle</code> block. <br />
                <img class="indent" src="../../afb/" />
                <div class="endnote"> Note the use of <code>pen down</code> and <code>pen up</code> blocks inside the
                    rectangle definition. We don't normally do this but here this is done to simplify the more complex
                    code coming ahead. This will ensure that once a rectangle is drawn, the pen is up and you don’t need
                    to worry about unintended scribbles as your drawing sprite continues moving to execute the rest of
                    the code.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                Also recall the <code>pinwheel</code> code you have written in Unit 1.<br />
                <img class="indent" src="../../afb/" />
            </li>
            <li>
                In this project, you will replace the <em><strong>pinwheel branches</strong></em> with
                <em><strong>rectangles</strong></em> as shown below. Note use of color is optional and is used here for
                clarity.<br />
                <img class="indent" src="../../afb/" />
                <img src="../../afb/" /> <br />


                Now create a <code>pinwheel with rectangles</code> block. It will have two more inputs <var>width</var>
                and <var>length</var> for the width and length of the rectangles.<br />
                <img class="indent" src="../../afb/" /><br />
                Its code will be identical to the <code>pinwheel</code> code except that it has the
                <code>rectangle</code> block inserted in between the two <code>move</code> blocks that created the
                pinwheel branches. <br />
                <img class="indent" src="../../afb/" /><br />

            </li>
            <li>
                Now, use the “Variables” menu to make variables that will allow you to vary all aspects of the designs
                you create and do not forget to initialize these variables right after the <code>when green flag
                    clicked</code> block<br />
                <img class="indent" src="../../afb/" />
            </li>
            <li>
                You can turn these variables to alterable sliders by right-clicking on the variable icon that is shown
                on stage and choosing the “slider” option. And then you can set the minimum and maximum values of a
                slider as shown.<br />
                <img src="../../afb/" /><br />
                The following should be reasonable values for the minimum and maximum of each variable:<br />
                <div class="sidenote">You can change these minimum and maximum values as you generate and explore new
                    designs.</div>
                <table class="indent bordered">
                    <tr>
                        <th style="text-align:center">&nbsp;Variable&nbsp;</th>
                        <th>Minimum</th>
                        <th>Maximum</th>

                    <tr>
                        <td>&nbsp;<var>number of branches</var>&nbsp; </td>
                        <td>3</td>
                        <td>36</td>

                Click on the animation below to see an example of how you can use the slider functionality in
                Snap<em>!</em> to generate and explore a vast number of variations of your designs. <br />
                <img class="indent" data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/EgyptianMotif_img/sliderAnimationDemo.gif"

            </li>
            <li>
                Your code needs to make sure that the computer is always on the watch in case any of the variables are
                changed by the user via the sliders. You can do so with a <code>forever</code> block.<br />
                <img class="indent" src="../../afb/" />
                <div class="endnote">The <code>warp</code> block makes sure that the <code>pinwheel with
                        rectangles</code> is drawn all at once rather than step by step.</div>
            </li>
            <li>Once the code is written check to make sure everything works as intended. You may need to position your
                drawing spite appropriately to make best use of the stage you have. Now move each of your sliders to
                generate and explore a vast variety of designs inspired by Islamic art.</li>
            <div class="endnote">
                Use these buttons to maximize your stage to give enough room for your sliders.<br />

            <li>Add color to your rectangles by inserting <img src="../../afb/" /> into the <code>pinwheel with

                Take screenshots of your creations and share with the class. Put them on a class web page if you have
                one. Below are some examples of the types of variations you can generate.<br />
                <div class="sidenote">You may want to <img src="../../afb/" /> the drawing Sprite (Arrow) before taking
