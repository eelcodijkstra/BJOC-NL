    <h2>Modeling Language: Plurals, Part 2</h2>

    <div class="todo">
        <ul>
            <li>REVISION NOTE: Students EXTEND their <strong>list</strong> of nouns as needed. At each testing stage,
                have them <strong>map</strong> their &quot;specialist block&quot; or their <strong>plural </strong>block
                over the entire list and note which words are and aren't correctly pluralized.</li>
            <li>Rebuild the images without white backgrounds. --MF</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>You can improve <code>plural</code> to work correctly with more words. If the project is not already open, please
        reload it. (The suggested file name was <code>U2-Plural</code>.) </p>

    <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Abstraction: </strong> Make a <img src="../../afb/" on just one category, words that end with
                    the letter <strong>h</strong>.
                <ul>
                    <li>Start with a <code>list</code> of the words you want it to work for.</li>
                    <li>This specialist block should work correctly for words that fit its specialty <img
                            src="../../afb/"> because the <code>plural</code> block should never give words to
                        <code>plural-h</code> unless those words end with <strong>h</strong>. </li>
                    <li>Test <img src="../../afb/"> with a variety of words to make sure it works the way you want. Then
                        use <code>map</code> to test it on the entire <code>list</code> you made earlier.</li>
                </ul>

            </li>
            <div class="takeNote">
                <p><strong>Abstraction: </strong> Language often has special cases. In English, the plurals ofsome nouns
                    add <em>s</em>; some add <em>es</em>; nouns like <em>calf</em> and <em>fly</em> become
                    <em>calves</em> and <em>flies</em>, changing their final letters before adding <em>es</em>. And
                    more. For a programming task this complex, it's (generally) best to break it into parts, handle each
                    part separately with its own procedure (its own block), and then have the "top-level" block—in this
                    case, <code>plural</code>, itself—use those specialists. That is, instead of coding every little
                    detail directly in <code>plural</code>, it is cleaner and clearer to make <code>plural</code> look
                    something like this.</p>
                <p><img class="indent" src="../../afb/"></p>
                <p>Showing<a name="abstraction" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>the <em>structure</em> of the method—just the
                    overall strategy—in the "top-level" block and leaving the details to separate blocks is one part of
                    an important computer science idea called <strong>abstraction</strong>. Abstraction keeps your code
                    clear, readable, and more easily debugged. It will also help your code be more flexible. </p>
            </div>
            <li> When you trust your new specialist block, edit <code> plural</code> to use the specialist. Test (you
                can use <code>map</code>) to make sure <code>plural</code> still works for all the words it used to work
                for, as well as the new ones.</li>
            <li> Create <code>plural-y</code> to handle words like
                <img src="../../afb/"> and
                <img src="../../afb/">
            </li>
            <p>Remember, any specialist can make mistakes if it's asked to do a job that isn't its specialty. <img
                    src="../../afb/"> </p>
            <p>Make sure <code>plural</code> gives it only the job it knows how to handle correctly.</p>
            <img class="imageRight" src="../../afb/" />
        </ol>
    </div>


    <div class="takeItFurther"><a name="further" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>
        <ol type="A">
            <li>Because you know what <img src="../../afb/"></li>
            <li>Extend <code>plural</code> to handle another special case. Use a special-purpose block for your special
                case to keep <code>plural</code> from becoming cluttered.</li>
            <li>Right now, if <code>plural</code> is given a word with a space at the end, it leaves that space in the
                plural, like this: <img src="../../afb/">. You already have a block that <em>specializes</em> in making
                plurals of words that <em>don't</em> have a space at the end. <em>Use</em> it.</li>
            <li><strong>Surprise!</strong> Once <code>plural</code> works for a single space at the end of a word, try
                giving it <img src="../../afb/">. That works!! But why?!</li>
        </ol>
