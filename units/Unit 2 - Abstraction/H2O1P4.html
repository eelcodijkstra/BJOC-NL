    <h2>Modeling Language: Plurals, Part 1</h2>
    <div class="todo">
        <p>We discussed moving the TIF up to the top before the FYTD--something like: You can do this whole project in
            any language you want (your native language or one you are learning.) --MF, 5/22/18</p>
        <p>There are some images that need attention on this page. --MF, 6/6/18</p>
    </div>

    <div class="learn">
        Siri and other robots are programmed to generate language. Siri speaks; some robots write. You have developed a
        program, <code>gossip</code>, that writes. Now, you can extend the computer's abilities with language by
        developing a reporter block, <code>plural</code>, that takes a noun as input and correctly spells and outputs
        the plural. <br />
        <img src="../../afb/" />
        <img src="../../afb/" /> <br /> Spelling a plural can seem almost automatic for a person, but it is not simple:
        a computer needs an algorithm to do that task.

    <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
        <div class="sidenote">This project uses blocks already loaded for you from Snap<em>!</em>'s "Words, sentences"
            library. You can load a library from the File menu <img src="../../afb/" .</div> <ol>
            <li>
                To do this project, you will need to use the new blocks <img src="../../afb/" />, which you used in Unit
                1 Lab 2, Gossip and Greet.<br />

                Try all its expressions (the nine one-line scripts) and experiment with their inputs until you are sure
                you understand what they do. For each expression, say what that script does <em>in general</em> not just
                what it does with this particular input. (Example: <img src="../../afb/"> reports <em>y</em>, but you
                want to say what <code>last letter of</code> will report if, say, <code>2017</code> is its input.)

            <div class="endnote">You won't need <img src="../../afb/" Linguists use evidence like this to understand the
                    history of a language.</div> <div class="sidenote">
                Choose the <em>reporter</em> button when you make <code>plural</code>.<br />
                <img src="../../afb/" />
            </div>
            <li>Here's one way to start building the <code>plural</code> block. Build this much and test it out on at
                least "day" and "boss" and "medicine," to make sure it works correctly for those. If it does not, edit
                and fix it. <br /> <img class="indent" src="../../afb/" /></li>
            <li><strong>Debugging: </strong> Try to find words for which this version of <code>plural</code> does
                <em>not</em> work correctly. List the words you find. <em>Organize that list</em>, sorting the words
                into categories according to their last letter. For example, it will get wrong some words that end with
                the letter <em>h</em>. Try to find many words it gets wrong. </li>
            <li>
                <strong><em>Save your list.</em></strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create a Snap<em>!</em> list like this <img src="../../afb/"> containing <em>all</em> of your
                        words.</li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="saveAs"><span class="text">"U2-Plural"</span><img src="../../afb/" /> <em>Save your
                                file</em>. You will need this list. </div>

            <div class="takeNote">
                <p><strong>Debugging: </strong>To write code that works, you want to try to find situations in which it
                    does <em>not</em> work. "Breaking it" requires thinking of wild and exceptional cases, even
                    including inputs that are incorrect in some way, like this example, which has a space at the end.

                <code>plural</code> should now work correctly for "day" and "boss" and "medicine," but it probably
                doesn't yet work correctly for the word "box"<br />
                <img class="indent" src="../../afb/" />.
                <p> Edit your <code>plural</code> block to make it work for words that end with x. <em>Test</em> it to
                    make sure it does work properly.</p>

        <p>You can do the same for conjugating verbs in Spanish or some other language you choose. See the Take It
            Further section at the bottom.</p>
        <p>The next two steps are worth learning—very useful for <em>testing</em> <code>plural</code> and in more
            advanced work later on—but not essential for <em>building</em> <code>plural</code>.</p>

                <li>
                    Use <code>map</code> to test <em>all</em> the words on your list. Leave the slot in
                    <code>plural</code> <strong>empty</strong>, as you see here. The <code>map</code> block inserts each
                    element of the list into that slot and reports a list of the results.<img src="../../afb/">
                    <p>For now, don't worry about the words it still gets wrong, as long as it works for "day," "boss,"
                        "medicine," and "box." </p>
                </li>
                <li>In your <code>map</code> script, replace <code>plural</code> with<img src="../../afb/">. Try it. Now
                    explain what the <code>map</code> block does, <em>in general</em>. </li>
                <li>

                    <img src="../../afb/"><br />
                    to see what they do. Again, leave the slot in <code>last letter of</code> <strong>empty</strong>, as
                    you see here. That is the placeholder for <code>keep</code> to test each word the list. Explain what
                    the <code>keep</code> block does.

                    If you know another language, build a block that takes a pronoun and verb as input and outputs the
                    correct form of that verb. For example:<br />
